```javascript
const teams = [
  { name: 'Team 1', members: ['Paul', 'Lisa'] },
  { name: 'Team 2', members: ['Laura', 'Tim'] },
];

function* getMembers(members) {
  for (let i = 0; i < members.length; i++) {
    yield members[i];
  }
}

function* getTeams(teams) {
  for (let i = 0; i < teams.length; i++) {
    // ✨ SOMETHING IS MISSING HERE ✨
  }
}

const obj = getTeams(teams);
obj.next(); // { value: "Paul", done: false }
obj.next(); // { value: "Lisa", done: false }
```

## Explanation

In order to iterate over the `members` in each element in the `teams` array, we need to pass `teams[i].members` to the `getMembers` generator function. The generator function returns a generator object. In order to iterate over each element in this generator object, we need to use `yield*`.

If we would've written `yield`, `return yield`, or `return`, the entire generator function would've gotten returned the first time we called the `next` method.
